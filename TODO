- Refactor #:primary-key 'id to (id 'primary-key) ?
- Nice error message when attempting to use procedures that need a primary key without one.
- Automatically check the code style - some procedures are too long for example
- How to read/write time values, for example srfi-19 times?
  We may add a column type definition in define-database-record-mapping macro?
- Test with other values: integers, doubles, #t, blobs (bytevector), what else?
- Avoid the extra round trip with 'CREATE TABLE',
  call only when necessary, or call together with the statement.
- Execute all updates in a single statement
- Create helper method 'call-with-prepared-statement' to finalize the statement automatically.
